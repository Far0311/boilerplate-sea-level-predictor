# Sea Level Predictor

This is the boilerplate for the Sea Level Predictor project. Instructions for building your project can be found at https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-projects/sea-level-predictor

Code has been modified by Farisha in sea_level_predictor.py. This code will generate a scatter-plot chart that analyzes a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. The regression line data is used to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
